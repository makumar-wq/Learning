# Daily Learning Log: Java Core & JVM Internals

**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Focus:** JVM Memory, Input, Arrays, and Methods

Today I went deeper into how Java actually works under the hood (JVM), alongside learning standard tools like Arrays and Scanner.

### 📝 Topics Covered
1.  **JVM Internals:** Stack vs. Heap memory, and the application entry point.
2.  **Reading Input:** Using the `Scanner` class correctly.
3.  **Strings:** Immutability and processing text.
4.  **Arrays:** Storing multiple values and iterating with loops.
5.  **Methods:** Organizing code into reusable blocks.
