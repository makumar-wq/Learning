DAY_01 :
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) : 
1. Encapsulation: Built a BankAccount class using private fields and public getters/methods to secure data (Industry Standard).
Static Keyword: Implemented class-level variables (shared memory) to track global state (e.g., total accounts) independent of individual objects.
2. Inheritance: Extended classes (SavingsAccount extends BankAccount) to reuse code and specialized behavior using super() and @Override.
3. Polymorphism: Explored "Is-A" relationships, upcasting (BankAccount b = new SavingsAccount()), and the necessity of type-checking (instanceof) before downcasting.

<b>I also completed a Mini-Capstone Project (ATM Backend) to implement Abstract Classes, Polymorphism, and Arrays in a unified system. Intention is to implement all the things that i learned today</b>
